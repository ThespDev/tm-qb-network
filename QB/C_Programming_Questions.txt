C Programming Questions

Q:
What are the key features in the C programming language?

A:
Features are as follows:

    Portability: It is a platform-independent language.
    Modularity: Possibility to break down large programs into small modules.
    Flexibility: The possibility of a programmer to control the language.
    Speed: C comes with support for system programming and hence it compiles and executes with high speed when compared with other high-level languages.
    Extensibility: Possibility to add new features by the programmer.

Q:
What are the basic data types associated with C?

A:
    Int – Represent the number (integer)
    Float – Number with a fraction part.
    Double – Double-precision floating-point value
    Char – Single character
    Void – Special purpose type without any value.

Q:
What is the description for syntax errors?

A:
The mistakes/errors that occur while creating a program are called syntax errors. Misspelled commands or incorrect case commands, an incorrect number of parameters in calling method /function, data type mismatches can be identified as common examples for syntax errors.

Q:
What is the process to create increment and decrement statement in C?

A:
There are two possible methods to perform this task.

    Use increment (++) and decrement (-) operator.

Example When x=4, x++ returns 5 and x- returns 3.

    Use conventional + or – sign.

Example When x=4, use x+1 to get 5 and x-1 to get 3.

Q:
What are reserved words with a programming language?

A:
The words that are a part of the standard C language library are called reserved words. Those reserved words have special meaning and it is not possible to use them for any activity other than its intended functionality.

Example: void, return int.
