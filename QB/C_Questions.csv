#Question Number,Question Type (Multi-choice/Text/Code),Question Body,QuestionAnwser/ExpectedResult,Questionpsotibilities(multichoiceonly)
1,Text,What are the key features in the C programming language?,Portability: It is a platform-independent language. Modularity: Possibility to break down large programs into small modules. Flexibility: The possibility of a programmer to control the language.  Speed: C comes with support for system programming and hence it compiles and executes with high speed when compared with other high-level languages.     Extensibility: Possibility to add new features by the programmer.,
2,Text,What are the basic data types associated with C?,Int – Represent the number (integer) Float – Number with a fraction part. Double – Double-precision floating-point value Char – Single character Void – Special purpose type without any value. ,
3,Text,What is the description for Syntax Errors,"The mistakes/errors that occur while creating a program are called syntax errors. Misspelled commands or incorrect case commands, an incorrect number of parameters in calling method /function, data type mismatches can be identified as common examples for syntax errors.",
4,Text,What is the process to create increment and decrement statement in C?,"There are two possible methods to perform this task.    Use increment (++) and decrement (-) operator.  Example When x=4, x++ returns 5 and x- returns 3.      Use conventional + or – sign.  Example When x=4, use x+1 to get 5 and x-1 to get 3.",
5,Text,What are reserved words with a programming language?,"The words that are a part of the standard C language library are called reserved words. Those reserved words have special meaning and it is not possible to use them for any activity other than its intended functionality. Example: void, return int. ",
6,MCA,Which of the following is not a valid data type in C?,a) int b) string c) float d) char ,b
7,MCA,"What is the output of the following code snippet?  >int x = 5; printf(""%d\n"", x++);<",a) 6 b) 5 c) Error d) Undefined,b
8,MCA,"What is the purpose of the ""break"" keyword in C?",a) To end a loop or switch statement b) To skip a loop iteration c) To continue executing a loop d) None of the above,a
9,MCA,Which of the following is a valid way to declare a pointer in C?,a) int* x; b) int *x; c) int * x; d) All of the above,d
10,MCA,What is the value of x after the following code snippet?  >int x = 10; x += 5;<,a) 5 b) 10 c) 15 d) 20,c
11,Code,Write Code to output “Hello World”,"arg: expected:”Hello World""",
12,Code,Write Code to output and argument as a string,"arg: Hello expected: “Hello”; arg: 1 expceted: “1""",
